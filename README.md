# Java-based Full-Stack Web Application

## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based full-stack web application that combines a Spring Boot backend with a React frontend. The application is designed to manage user, product, and order information stored in a MySQL database, providing a robust solution for modern web applications.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Set up the backend:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Make sure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) installed.
   - Build the project using Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```
   - Configure your MySQL database in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

3. **Run the backend application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Set up the frontend:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

5. **Run the frontend application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once both the backend and frontend applications are running, you can access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features
- User management: Register, login, and authenticate users.
- Product management: Add, update, and delete products.
- Order processing: Create and manage orders associated with users and products.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Dependencies
The project uses various dependencies managed in the `pom.xml` file for the Spring Boot backend:
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- MySQL Connector
- Thymeleaf (if applicable)

For the frontend, dependencies can be found in `package.json` and typically include:
- React
- React Router
- Axios (for handling HTTP requests)
